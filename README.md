# LetsChatSPA

# Description
I have created this SPA using Angular 9 (for creating frontend) and Stream-Chat (for chat functionality).
I'm using my stream chat credentials (key and secret) in the .env file in the root folder which can be updated after creating your own stream-chat account.

# Build instructions (Please note point 4 and 5 are optional since you can use my credentials)
1. Clone this repository.
2. Change your directory to this repo.
3. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies
4. Create a stream-chat account and then create an app there.
5. Update the.env file with new key and secret details from your own account.
6. Run 'node server.js' from the project root to start the Node server on port 5500.
7. Run 'ng serve' from the project root to start the Angular app server.
8. View the app by using http://localhost:4200 in your browser.
